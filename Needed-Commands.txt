I suggest you guys use Github desktop and VScode.
`https://desktop.github.com/
`https://code.visualstudio.com/

To VSCode to work with git you also need Git Bash 
`https://git-scm.com/

NOTE:
  While installing VScode or git or github desktop, please select the "ADD TO PATH" setting.

~~ How to update a fork Repo ~~
  -Using git-bash or cmd, navigate to the project or fork folder
  -Run the following commands
      `git fetch upstream            //Fetching the changes from the main repo
      `git checkout master          //navigating to master branch
      `git merge upstream/master   //merging the fork repo and main repo :D
